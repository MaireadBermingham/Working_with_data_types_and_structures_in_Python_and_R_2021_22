    "# Collecting data entered into the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to use the `array()` function from the *numpy* Python package to collect data entered into the notebook. The *numpy* package is the core package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. A *numpy*  array is a grid of values, all of the same type. We are going to name each collection of data, and then perform a numerical operation to calculate BMI. In this example we conduct an analysis that is analogous to working in a spreadsheet.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate BMI we need to divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. We use the `power()` function from the *numpy*  package square height. The `power()` function treats elements in the first input array as a base and returns it raised to the power of the corresponding component of the second input array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter will only print the result of the last line in a cell. You will need to use the the Python `print()` function to print the output from earlier lines. The Python `print()` function takes in any number of parameters, and prints them out on one line of text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the `matrix()` function from the *numpy*  package to combine the Height, Weight and BMI arrays, and the `transpose()` function from the *numpy*  package to assign record number as rows, and the Height , Weight and BMI arrays as columns to the matrix. The `matrix()` function returns a matrix from an array-like object, or from a string of data. A matrix is a specialized 2-D array that retains its 2-D nature through operations. The `matrix()` function reverses the axes of an array.  "
